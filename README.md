# voiceAssistant
Just a general task doing voice assistant to automate my life.
Note that the API key in weatherPY is fake as I don't wanna give out any API keys, so if you wanna use it, go to openweathermap and replace this api key with yours.  I have also deleted all credentials in the project that uses the gmailapi as I don't want anyone hacking into my gmail.

I also stream making it on Tech with Tim discord and am planning to stream it on Youtube.
